Multiblock and multigrid lattice Boltzmann methods in domain of complex geometries

This MATLAB library implements the examples of lattice Boltzmann methods in the thesis <br/>
[The Lattice Boltzmann Method for Fluid Dynamics: Theory and Applications](https://github.com/cpempire/MMLBM/tree/master/thesis)
<br/>
which includes Poiseuille flow, lid driven cavity flow, Womersley flow, Taylor-Couette flow, blood flow in aneurysms, etc.
